						<h2>History</h2>
						 Originally, Mboro was nothing more than a tiny Peul hamlet. It was part of the Cayor Kingdom which 
						 split from the Djolof empire in 1549. The Cayor Kingdom was ruled by Wolof Damels, of whom Lat Dior was the last and most 
						 famous.It operated under a cast system in which Damels were selected by a council representative of people from all 
						 walks of life.<br>
						 In the late 14<sup>th</sup> century, Damels started trading with Europeans who were then allowed to build trade posts. Over the years, they agreed to pay annual taxes to the Damel until 
						 the 19<sup>th</sup> century when the colonization process began.
						 In 1862, Pinet Laprade, Faidherbe's successor as Governor of Senegal with his troops, discovered the hamlet of Mboro on their way from Saint Louis to Dakar. He instantly saw it's huge agricultural potential.
						 Later on, the French Colonial Administration in West Africa decided to start in the region, a vegetables and fruit production spot. Offering land, seeds and farming machinery, they encouraged folks from all corners of the country to come to settle there. 
						 Hence the heterogeneous feature of Mboro's today population. It's a direct legacy of that historic move and mirrors the diverse indigenous who volunteered to populate it in the first place.<br>

						<h2>Geography</h2>
						Mboro is administratively part of the region of Thies, and the department of Tivaoune.<br>
						The town is nested in northwestern Senegal nicknamed "la Grande côte". A vast coastline area following the Atlantic Ocean from Dakar to Saint Louis.
						The climate is mild most of the year, from October to June as the nearby sea plays a thermal regulator role. The diverse landscape is 
						characterized by a sharp cleavage that will meet different leisure needs. On the east, a succession of sandy dunes, some as high as 20 meters, 
						will give you a feeling of total change of scenery and an awesome playground to hiking enthusiasts.
						Towards the greener west of the town, a wide pristine forest of filao trees planted between the sea and arable lands to prevent soil erosion, host a variety of small wild animals 
						and birds. A perfect place to get away from everyday hassles.

						<h2>Transport</h2>
						Mboro is 117kms away from the capital Dakar. It's two or three hours drive if you are not stuck in traffic jams. For decades, passengers shuttling between the two cities
						had been taking a big detour via the National Road to avoid the shorter but pothole-riddled "Route des Niayes". Happily it has been recently refurbished and the travel time has now significantly shrunk. 
						To move from Dakar to Mboro, you can take the outlandish senegalese bus called "taxi brousse". But for a quicker painless journey, you'd better opt for the seven-seated car commonly known as "Sept places".
						Do not spend more than 3000 fcfa (5.5$).
						To wander around Mboro, you can catch a "taxi-clando" for 200 fcfa (0.36 $) if your trajectory is not off the only paved main avenue.
						But if ever you want to venture into the sandy streets, walking or hailing the lovely traditional carriage would be more appropriate.

						<h2>Accommodation</h2>
							Obviously Mboro is not a big touristic destination. So don't expect to spend your journey in high-end five stars hotels.<br>
							I assume it's not what your are looking for anyway. From my perspective, the best way to mingle with the locals is to stay within a family proposing a bed-and-breakfast styled service. 
							However the downside is that communication might really be tricky as they are likely not to speak a single world of English. 
							For greater comfort and provided that you can afford it, there are a few inns operated in the isolated district of "Thiérangal" by some Europeans. 
							Up to you to make a choice depending on your budget and travel expectations.<br>
							Following are some contact numbers for accommodation options in Mboro I gleaned on the Internet. I have to caution that I've not tried out these facilities.
							So I cannot guarantee anything about the quality of service.<br>
